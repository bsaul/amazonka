-- Creates a new lifecycle configuration for the bucket or replaces an
-- existing lifecycle configuration. For information about lifecycle
-- configuration, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html Managing your storage lifecycle>.
--
-- Bucket lifecycle configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle rule
-- using an object key name prefix, one or more object tags, or a
-- combination of both. Accordingly, this section describes the latest API.
-- The previous version of the API supported filtering based only on an
-- object key name prefix, which is supported for backward compatibility.
-- For the related API description, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycle.html PutBucketLifecycle>.
--
-- __Rules__
--
-- You specify the lifecycle configuration in your request body. The
-- lifecycle configuration is specified as XML consisting of one or more
-- rules. Each rule consists of the following:
--
-- -   Filter identifying a subset of objects to which the rule applies.
--     The filter can be based on a key name prefix, object tags, or a
--     combination of both.
--
-- -   Status whether the rule is in effect.
--
-- -   One or more lifecycle transition and expiration actions that you
--     want Amazon S3 to perform on the objects identified by the filter.
--     If the state of your bucket is versioning-enabled or
--     versioning-suspended, you can have many versions of the same object
--     (one current version and zero or more noncurrent versions). Amazon
--     S3 provides predefined actions that you can specify for current and
--     noncurrent object versions.
--
-- For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html Object Lifecycle Management>
-- and
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html Lifecycle Configuration Elements>.
--
-- __Permissions__
--
-- By default, all Amazon S3 resources are private, including buckets,
-- objects, and related subresources (for example, lifecycle configuration
-- and website configuration). Only the resource owner (that is, the Amazon
-- Web Services account that created it) can access the resource. The
-- resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to others by
-- writing an access policy. For this operation, a user must get the
-- s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration permission.
--
-- You can also explicitly deny permissions. Explicit deny also supersedes
-- any other permissions. If you want to block users or accounts from
-- removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must deny them
-- permissions for the following actions:
--
-- -   s3:DeleteObject
--
-- -   s3:DeleteObjectVersion
--
-- -   s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration
--
-- For more information about permissions, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources>.
